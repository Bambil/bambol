# Hapi
## Introduction  
This is my own customization of [Hapi.js](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi) framework. This customization includes the Vue.js and bootstrap 4 as the frontend, and sass compiler, and webpack as js mimifier.
## Installation  
Installation is pretty simple, you should just 
```sh
yarn
```
Before installation make sure that you have ```yarn``` installed. For more information see [here](https://yarnpkg.com/)
